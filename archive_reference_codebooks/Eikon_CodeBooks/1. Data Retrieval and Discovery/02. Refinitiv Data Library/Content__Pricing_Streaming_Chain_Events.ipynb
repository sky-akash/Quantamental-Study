    "To use a Chain stream object with events, you need to define callback functions that are called by a background execution thread when new events are received for the chain you requested. There are 5 different types of callback functions you can use depending on the type of events you are interrested in. These callback functions are optionnal meaning that you do not have to use all of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The 5 events types and their related callback functions:\n",
    " - **add events:** add events happen when a new constituent is added to a chain. When several Add events are received for the same index, only the the last received constituent is kept in memory. Other constituents received from the same index are discarded. Chain stream objects automatically manage this logic for their internal cache, meaning that when you call get_constituent you always get the latest list of constituents.\n",

    "  - The Chains that received the event\n",
